##### Theorem
The symmetric group on n letters, $S_n$, is a group with $n!$ elements, where the binary operation is the composition of maps.

##### Proof
The identity of $S_n$ is just the identity map that sends 1 to 1,2 to 2, ..., $n$ to $n$. If $f: S_n \rightarrow S_n$ is a permutation, then $f^{-1}$ exists, since $f$ is one-to-one and onto; hence, every [[Permutation]] has an inverse. Composition of maps is associative, which makes the group operation associative. We leave the proof that $\vert S_n \vert = n!$ as an exercise.

A subgroup of $S_n$ is called a [[Permutation]] group.
