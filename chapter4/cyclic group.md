##### Theorem
Let $G$ be a [[group]] and $a$ be any element in $G$. Then the set $$<a> = \{ a^k : k\in\mathbb{Z}\}$$ is a [[subgroup]] of $G$. Furthermore, $<a>$ is the smallest [[subgroup]] of $G$ that contains $a$.

---

##### Definition
If $G$ contains some element $a$ such that $G = <a>$, then $G$ is a cyclic group, and in this case $a$ is a generator of $G$.

---

##### Theorem
Every cyclic group is [[abelian]]

---

##### Theorem
Every [[subgroup]] of a cyclic group is cyclic

###### Corollary
The subgroups of $\mathbb{Z}$ are exactly $n\mathbb{Z}$ for $n = 0,1,2\dots$

---

##### Theorem
Let G be a cyclic group of order $n$ and suppose that $a\in G$ is a generator of the group. If $b = a^k$, then the order of $b$ is $n/d$ where $d = gcd(k,n)$.

###### Corollary
The generators of $\mathbb{Z_n}$ are the integers $r$ such that $1\leq r < n$ and $gcd (r, n) = 1$
